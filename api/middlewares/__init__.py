"""
Modularized middlewares extracted from api/main.py.

This package contains HTTP middlewares organized by responsibility for better
maintainability and testability.

Extracted from api/main.py (lines 266-488) as part of refactoring to reduce
file size from 1,603 â†’ <500 lines.

Note: The original api/middleware.py file contains RateLimitMiddleware and
ErrorHandlingMiddleware which remain separate to avoid migration complexity.
