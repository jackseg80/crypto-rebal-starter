Location assignment service for rebalancing actions.

    Add location (exchange) information to trading actions.

    For SELL actions, splits the action across multiple exchanges proportionally
    to the actual holdings (value_usd) on each exchange.

    Args:
        plan: Rebalancing plan containing actions
        rows: Current balance rows with symbol, location, value_usd
        min_trade_usd: Minimum trade size in USD (default: 25.0)

    Returns:
        Updated plan with locations assigned to actions

    Logic:
        - If action already has a specific location (not Unknown/CoinTracking), keep it
        - For SELL actions: Split across exchanges proportionally to holdings
        - For BUY actions: Leave as-is (UI will choose exchange)
        - If split results in trades < min_trade_usd, consolidate to biggest exchange
